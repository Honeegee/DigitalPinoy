A lineup of classic Nokia models (such as the 3310, 3210, etc.) popular in the early 2000s. These phones were prized for their ruggedness, long battery life, and simplicity. For many Filipino youth, owning a Nokia candy-bar phone was both a status symbol and a tool for staying connected via SMS (“texting”), coordinating meetups, and sending greetings. These were often shared among friends—text message jokes, chain messages, or arranging barkada hangouts.
