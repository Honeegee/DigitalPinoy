Here you see another view of an Internet café with rows of computers set up for both work and play. For many young people, these spaces were the first places to experience multiplayer or LAN gaming (e.g. Counter-Strike, Ragnarok Online) and social interaction beyond face-to-face. These cafés also became informal venues for after-school hangouts, homework collaboration, and even early digital content creation. The cost of owning a computer or maintaining a stable connection at home was still high, so cafés were essential access points.
