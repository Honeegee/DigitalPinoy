Here you see a group of feature phones in assorted colors and styles. These weren’t yet smartphones—no touchscreens, limited internet—but they carried features that excited youth: polyphonic ringtones, customizable covers, camera phones (in later years), and basic mobile games like Snake. The choice of phone color or design became a way to express individuality and belonging—“I have the silver one,” “mine vibrates louder,” etc. Messaging and calls became more immediate and personal with these devices.
