This photo shows a typical internet café (or “computer shop”) where many Filipinos—especially students and young professionals—first accessed the Internet outside the home. These venues offered time-based rental of PCs with dial-up or early broadband connectivity. They were hubs for doing research, sending emails, chatting on ICQ or MSN, browsing Friendster or early social networks, and trying out online games. The communal, public character of these cafés helped spread internet literacy and digital culture beyond affluent households.
