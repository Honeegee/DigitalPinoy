A late-2000s gaming rig running Counter-Strike 1.6, complete with CRT or early flat panel display, often at an internet café or “computer shop.” In this era, such shops were social hubs: players would gather physically, rent PCs by the hour, form impromptu teams, and compete in matches. Counter-Strike was popular for its multiplayer, team coordination, and competitiveness. It wasn’t just a game—it was a way for friends to meet after school or on weekends, and even compete in local tournaments.
