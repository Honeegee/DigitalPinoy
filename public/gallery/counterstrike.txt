This is the menu screen of Counter-Strike: Condition Zero (2004), an updated version of the classic CS franchise. It represents how PC games developed through mods, official updates, and new editions over the 2000-10 decade. Players might wait for upgraded maps, better graphics, or extra modes. Such games also encouraged computer literacy: installing, updating, tweaking settings, joining servers. These features added layers of involvement beyond just playing—players became semi-tech hobbyists.
