A collection showing early candy-bar phones, sliders, and perhaps some flip designs (or experimental shapes). As phones got more varied, features like SMS, MMS, basic internet (WAP/GPRS), simple camera functions, and mobile phone games began creeping in. In the Philippines, this meant youth could coordinate school projects, plan nights out, send pictures, and share mobile ringtones or wallpapers. Social coordination became faster and more spontaneous. Birthday wishes, announcements, pag-ibig (romantic) messages, barkada plans—all via mobile phone.
