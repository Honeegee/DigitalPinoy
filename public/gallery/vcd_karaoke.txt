This image shows a collection of VCDs, karaoke VCD/Videoke sets, CDs, and mixed media—reflecting how Filipinos consumed both music and video in the 2000s. Videoke (karaoke) was (and still is) a deeply ingrained cultural activity, with VCD karaoke allowing families and barkadas (groups of friends) to sing along at home. CDs offered higher fidelity for music listening, while VCDs delivered movies, music videos, and karaoke visuals—all in one affordable disc. These media formats empowered local music and film industries, helped distribute OPM (Original Pilipino Music), and made entertainment more interactive in everyday life.
