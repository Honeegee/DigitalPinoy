A VHS player (VCR) was a central fixture in many Filipino homes in the early 2000s. Long before streaming or widespread DVD use, families would rent VHS movies from local video rental shops (“renteras”) for the weekend. These machines enabled time-shifting (recording TV shows to watch later), shared viewing experiences in living rooms, and were part of the ritual of movie nights. Though picture quality and durability lagged behind later technologies, VHS tapes were affordable and widely available—making movies accessible to many outside big cinemas.
